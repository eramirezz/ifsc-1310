      <h2>REVISION/REFLECTION</h2>
      
     <p> Per our instructions I have collected feedback from a family member on my first attempt at the dragon project. The first thing I did was demonstrate how the page works, and opened all the links. Then allowed my family members to take a look on their own. The most important feedback that I got was that it was difficult to continue reading at times. I was also told that more images might help. So for the revised version, the first thing I did was change the font. The new font I think feels more on theme and is easy to read. I also added an image to the history page. I also considered adding one to the FAQ page, but ultimately decided not to, because for the most part, FAQ pages are straight to the point. I also tried to make the page look more clean, so that things would flow easier and maybe make it easier to read. One thing I did for this was make the dotted lines thinner and my borders sharper. I felt this gave it a more futuristic field, which is what the project entails.

<p>This semester has been a great learning experience. This is the first semester where I am involved in classes that will directly apply to my career path. And this class is one I feel will be a good foundation for future skill sets. The most important skill I learned in this class was how to use resources that are accessible to me. This field is ever evolving, so being able to incorporate new functions, and use your resources properly, is essential for staying up to date. And although I have learned very useful skills in this class, I do wish I would have reached out more and asked more questions. I definitely wouldn’t have struggled with certain concepts if I had and probably would have learned more.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
    
      <h5>Understanding Progressive Enhancement - A List Apart </h5>
      
      Progressive enhancement is a strategy that focuses on a piece of core content and progressively enhances that content to make it more complex and precise to the target audience. The article “Understanding Progressive Enhancement” begins by providing a brief history of how the practice of progressive enhancement came to be. It also explains the differences between the graceful degradation perspective and the progressive enchantment perspective. Graceful degradation perspective focuses on user experience throughout different browsers. Progressive enchantment perspective focuses on performance and content. Both functions help enhance the sites and its performance but they do slightly differ. To help explain the functions of progressive enhancement the article uses an illustration of a peanut m&m.The m&m is made of three layers: the peanut, the chocolate and the shell. The article compares the peanut to the content, the chocolate to the presentation, and the shell to the client side scripting.

        This article by freecodecamp “What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters” explains the importance of Progressive Enhancement and provides real world implications. I chose this article because I personally felt the need for a better understanding of Progressive Enhancement. I learn best with examples and this article added to the one from before. This article describes Progressive Enhancement as a methodology that is used for developing web applications by progressively adding more layers. This article highlights some core principles such as the importance of content and its accessibility to all web browsers. Progressive Enhancement must first provide a foundation with basic features. The article then moves on to examples of how Progressive Enhancement works. The first example is web fonts, although fonts can impact the web pages appearance greatly they can also cause a page to be slower if the user has a slow network with a heavy site. If such is the case, showing content is more important than waiting for fonts. The next example is initial html. It is preferred to load initial content from html rather than relying on scripts. Scripts are unreliable if a user is on a slow network. Overall progressive enhancement focuses on creating a strong foundation using basic web technologies that can be accessible in all browsers, which then allows for more complex features to be added. </p>
